        Nice to make your acquaintance! I am a former aircraft environmental and
        electrical tehcnicain for the Air Force who used the GI Bill to gain a
        B.Sc. in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies I performed
        research under network science study grants aimed at creating Android
        applications optimized for delay laden networks. After my graduation
        from York College in 2016, I worked as an embedded software engineer on
        RTOS such as INTEGRITY and VxWorks. Afterwards I found enjoyment and
        passion in creating UI using React.Js and web servers with NodeJs. Wow,
        so early into my career but I have used so many different technologies!
        Currently, I am continuing down the road of web development and
        engineering so as to become a strong full-stack software engineer.
