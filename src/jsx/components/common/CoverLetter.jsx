        Nice to make your acquaintance! I am a former aircraft environmental and
        electrical tehcnicain for the Air Force who used the GI Bill to gain a
        B.Sc. in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies I performed
        research under network science study grants aimed at creating Android
        applications optimized for delay laden networks. After my graduation
        from York College in 2016, I worked as an embedded software engineer on
        RTOS such as INTEGRITY and VxWorks. Afterwards I found enjoyment and
        passion in web development using React.Js UI and NodeJs web servers. I
        am still early into my career but have used so many different
        technologies! As of now I am looking to continue down the road of web
        development and engineering in hopes of becoming a strong full-stack
        software engineer.
